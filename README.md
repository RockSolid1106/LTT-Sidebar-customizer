# Linus Tech Tips forum sidebar customizer

A very basic Chrome extension to customize what is shown on the sidebar on www.linustechtips.com

I am in no way affilliated with Linus Media Group or the Linus Tech Tips forum

## Updated to v0.9.1 on 24th May, 2022
- Option to show Status Updates section on all pages. This is done by making a request to the main page and pulling the Status Updates section and concatenating it to the sidebar.
- Redesign of the configurator.
- [Minor] Option to manually set the margin on badges to 3px. This was previously done by default.
- New [documentation](https://github.com/RockSolid1106/LTT-Sidebar-customizer/blob/Chromium/documentation.md) for all features of the customizer.

If you're on mobile, you can open the menu with the three dots, then Addons, and then select this extension.
