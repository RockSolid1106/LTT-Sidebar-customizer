# Linus Tech Tips forum customizer

A basic Chrome extension to customize the www.linustechtips.com forum.

I am in no way affilliated with Linus Media Group or the Linus Tech Tips forum.

## Updated to v0.8.6 on 19th November, 2021
Changelogs:

#### Profile features
- You can now replace the title "Member" with the member's rank.
- You can remove the solutions count.
- You can now replace the decimal post count with the full post count. Above changes basically bring it to how it looked before the forum upgrade.

#### Misc
- You can choose to see the rank stats in the profile dropdown, which was only available in the mobile version of the site.
