# Linus Tech Tips forum sidebar customizer

A very basic Chrome extension to customize what is shown on the sidebar on www.linustechtips.com

I am in no way affilliated with Linus Media Group or the Linus Tech Tips forum

## Updated to v0.9.0 on 27th February, 2022
Changelogs:
- ***The script now also runs when the page on the thread is changed, or new replies have come in.***

- Post count will now have the icon to match the forum theme. This only applies if you don't hide solutions count.

- Changed the "Hide location" option to "Show location". If you update the extension, the option will remain the same, so you'll have to manually change it after you've updated.
- [Minor] Added "Industry Affiliates" and "Retired Staff" as an exception to remove the group name. This was previously being hidden.
- Minor bug fixes.
